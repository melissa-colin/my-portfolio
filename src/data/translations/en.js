    section1Title: "An Unconventional Journey Driven by Passion",
    section1p1: "My passion for computing began very early. At <strong>12 years old</strong>, I discovered Scratch; at <strong>13</strong>, I taught myself Python; and by <strong>15</strong>, I enrolled in a technical high school. I quickly realized that what fascinated me most was <strong>algorithms</strong>, more than web development or game creation. I experimented for a while—robotics, development, Arduino projects—before finding a true calling in <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>.",
    section1p2: "That spark came during an AI internship at Cali Intelligences, a startup specializing in computer vision and AI. It was a revelation. I then threw myself wholeheartedly into AI studies, determined to <strong>actively contribute to its advancement</strong>, especially through <strong>designing and refining deep learning model architectures</strong>.",
    section2Title: "A Determination to Pivot and Excel",
    section2p1: "Originally enrolled in a practice-oriented program, I made the bold decision to <strong>transition to academia</strong> to strengthen my theoretical foundation in mathematics and algorithms. I joined ENSEIRB-MATMECA, renowned for its academic rigor and its computer science track, despite numerous doubts surrounding my application. My determination paid off: I was admitted on merit, proving that <strong>motivation and self-learning can stand shoulder to shoulder with the most traditional paths</strong>.",

        abstract: "In recent years, explainable AI has been presented as the main solution for building trust between users and AI sys- tems. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose an empirical study on the link between the performance and explai- nability of four computer vision algorithms : ViT, ResNet50, VGG16 and InceptionV3. Our study uses three local explai- nability methods : LIME, SHAP and GradCam. We show that, while explainable AI can be a tool for challenging the artificial representation of an algorithm and its behavior, it can also present robustness problems or contradictory in- formation that undermines trust. Our results show that by multiplying the use of explainable AI algorithms to explain one prediction, it is possible to verify the reliability of the explanations and extracted information.",

              <strong>ai4industry</strong> is a week-long workshop for final-year engineering or master’s students from across France, held annually at ENSERB-MATMECA.
            </p>
            <p>
              As <strong>Networking Manager</strong>, I’m responsible for planning and coordinating the event, engaging participants, and managing the budget and resources for the networking session scheduled for Thursday afternoon during the workshop week.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the event, I oversee setup, coordinate teams and speakers, and manage sessions held in the lecture hall, including moderating roundtables and delivering opening and closing speeches.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the event, I lead a debrief to identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to make future networking sessions more dynamic and rewarding for all participants.
